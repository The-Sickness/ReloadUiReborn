Ever needed to do a quick reload of your Interface? Well this addon can solve your problems....Maybe.

 

This addon adds a Reload Button to the Game Menu. All you have to do is click on the "?" on your Action Bar to bring up the Game Menu. You will see that the Reload Button has been added. Once you click it your UI will automatically do a /reload. Very simple addon.

 

ReloadUiReborn works in all versions of the game. Any issues please let me know by using the "Issue" button.
